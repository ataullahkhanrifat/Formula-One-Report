# Formula-One-Report
Formula One Report Deep Analysis(1950-2020)


Here is the REQUIREMENT

I'd like to know who the most successful drivers and constructors are ...as well as the most common Grand Prix Events and Circuits

Success should be based on race wins and podiums

-->> A race win is a 1st place finish

-->> A podium is a top 3 finish

I want a seperate report page for Drivers and Constructors

Oh and also, can you please find a way to include Driver and Constructor Nationality as a dimension too?

I'd also like a Report page showing the most commonly used Grand Prix Events and Circuits. (If you can include a Map Visualization that would be great!)

Please have a summary page with high level information and let it navigate to the analysis pages
